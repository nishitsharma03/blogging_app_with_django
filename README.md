# user_auth_reg_upd_django

Mysite folder has the settings and the url paths and all the main stuff.
Acccounts and Personal are two apps in the current project.
Accounts manages login,register,logout,updating user information
Personal manages the home screen .

Things still needed to be worked upon-
Resetting user password. Currently only email and username can be changed.
Integrating the front-end.



Caution:

All html files should be inside a templates folder , that is how the path is set.
Do not change the classes in accounts/models.py , the variables should be exactly as they are for user registration and authentication .  
Do not change the form validations in accounts/forms.py , I have no clue how they work  but they do work.
