# user_auth_reg_upd_django

Mysite folder has the settings and the url paths and all the main stuff.<br>
Acccounts and Personal are two apps in the current project.<br>
Accounts manages login,register,logout,updating user information<br>
Personal manages the home screen .<br>

Things still needed to be worked upon-<br>
Change the reset password screen.<br>
Integrating the front-end.<br>



Caution:<br>

All html files should be inside a templates folder , that is how the path is set.<br>
Do not change the classes in accounts/models.py , the variables should be exactly as they are for user registration and authentication .  <br>
Do not change the form validations in accounts/forms.py , I have no clue how they work  but they do work.<br>
